In order to make this demo application compile and run, make sure to define the following 
resource strings in any xml resource file under the res folder of the project:

```xml
<string name="authenticator_sdk_key">YOUR MOBILE SDK KEY HERE</string>
<string name="authenticator_googlemapsv2_key">YOUR GOOGLE MAPS API V2 ANDROID KEY HERE</string>
```

The Authenticator SDK key is given by the LaunchKey Dashboard, and the Google Maps API v2 
key will allow you to use Google Maps in order to set Geofencing as one of the Security 
Factors. Check the developer documentation in the links below for more information.
